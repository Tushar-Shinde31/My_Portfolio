              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Introduction:</strong> The Music Playlist Management System project was developed to create a dynamic music management solution using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, focusing on usability, efficiency, and feature completeness. Built in C++ and leveraging doubly linked lists, stacks, and file handling, this system provides comprehensive control over playlist functionalities, including persistent storage and organized playlist navigation.
              </p>
              
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Objective:</strong> The primary objective was to design a music playlist tool that offers users seamless control over their playlists, including adding, deleting, searching, and playing songs. Furthermore, the system needed to track recently played songs and retain playlists between sessions through file I/O, enhancing both usability and functionality.
              </p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Doubly Linked List Structure:</strong> Doubly linked lists were chosen for efficient bidirectional navigation within the playlist, enabling quick insertion and deletion operations, ideal for managing large playlists.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Stack for Recently Played Songs:</strong> A stack was integrated to allow quick access to recently played tracks, enabling efficient tracking of the latest songs.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>File I/O for Persistence:</strong> File handling ensures playlists are saved and loaded seamlessly, allowing users to continue from their last session without manual data entry.

                <strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Ensuring data remains intact between sessions was critical. Implementing efficient file I/O operations allowed successful saving and loading of playlists, maintaining data integrity.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Efficient Navigation and Management:</strong> With the choice of doubly linked lists and stacks, the project effectively handles song management tasks with minimal time complexity, creating a smooth user experience.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Complexity Management:</strong> Sorting and file I/O introduced additional complexity, which was managed through modular coding practices, separating concerns and reducing dependencies.
              </p>
              
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Results:</strong> The system achieved a user-friendly interface that reliably manages playlists with intuitive features for song manipulation, playlist storage, and easy retrieval of recently played tracks. Efficiency in execution and memory management made this solution both practical and highly performant.
