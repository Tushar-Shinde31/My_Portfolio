                Introduction: The Music Playlist Management System project was developed to create a dynamic music management solution using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, focusing on usability, efficiency, and feature completeness. Built in C++ and leveraging doubly linked lists, stacks, and file handling, this system provides comprehensive control over playlist functionalities, including persistent storage and organized playlist navigation.

Objective: The primary objective was to design a music playlist tool that offers users seamless control over their playlists, including adding, deleting, searching, and playing songs. Furthermore, the system needed to track recently played songs and retain playlists between sessions through file I/O, enhancing both usability and functionality.

System Architecture & Design:

Doubly Linked List Structure: Doubly linked lists were chosen for efficient bidirectional navigation within the playlist. This structure enables quick insertion and deletion operations, ideal for managing large playlists.
Stack for Recently Played Songs: To allow quick access to recently played tracks, a stack was integrated, enabling efficient tracking of the latest songs.
File I/O for Persistence: File handling ensures that playlists are saved and loaded seamlessly, allowing users to continue from their last session without manual data entry.
Sorting Algorithm Integration: Sorting functions were added to enable users to organize their playlists, enhancing the navigation experience and ensuring playlists are easy to access in desired order.
Features:

Song Management: Users can add, delete, search, and play songs in their playlist.
Persistent Storage: Playlists are saved and loaded from external files, thanks to file I/O, allowing for a continuous experience across sessions.
Recently Played Tracking: The stack-based tracking feature logs recent songs, giving users quick access to their last played tracks.
Playlist Sorting: Users can sort playlists based on custom criteria, ensuring organized playlist management.
Challenges & Solutions:

Data Persistence: Ensuring data remains intact between sessions was critical. Implementing efficient file I/O operations allowed successful saving and loading of playlists, maintaining data integrity.
Efficient Navigation and Management: With the choice of doubly linked lists and stacks, the project effectively handles song management tasks with minimal time complexity, creating a smooth user experience.
Complexity Management: Sorting and file I/O introduced additional complexity, which was managed through modular coding practices, separating concerns and reducing dependencies.
Results: The system achieved a user-friendly interface that reliably manages playlists with intuitive features for song manipulation, playlist storage, and easy retrieval of recently played tracks. Efficiency in execution and memory management made this solution both practical and highly performant.

Conclusion: The Music Playlist Management System demonstrates the power of DSA principles in creating scalable, efficient, and feature-rich applications. This project emphasizes the importance of well-chosen data structures and showcases the impact of using doubly linked lists, stacks, and file I/O in building reliable and intuitive software solutions. This case study serves as an example of the effective application of DSA in real-world applications, balancing functionality with optimal performance.
